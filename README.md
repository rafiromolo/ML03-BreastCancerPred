# Breast Cancer Prediction

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world. It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area.<br>
The key challenges against its detection is how to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign (non cancerous).
